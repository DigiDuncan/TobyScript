* ENTRY NUMBER 1/
* This is it..^1.&* Time to do what the King&  has asked me to do./
* I will create the power to&  free us all./
* I will unleash the power of&  the SOUL./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 2/
* The barrier is locked by&  SOUL power../
* Unfortunately^1, this power&  cannot be recreated&  artificially./
* SOUL power can only be&  derived from what was&  once living./
* So^1, to create more^1, we&  will have to use what we&  have now.../
* The SOULs of monsters./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 3/
* But extracting a SOUL from&  a living monster would&  require incredible power.../
* Besides being impractical^1,&  doing so would instantly&  destroy the SOUL's host./
* And^1, unlike the persistent&  SOULs of humans.../
* The SOULs of most monsters&  disappear immediately upon&  death./
* If only I could make a&  monster's SOUL last.../%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 4/
* I've been researching humans&  to see if I can find any&  info about their SOULS./
* I ended up snooping around&  the castle...&* And found these weird tapes./
* I don't feel like ASGORE's&  watched them.../
* I don't think he should./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 5/
* I've done it./
* Using the blueprints^1, I've&  extracted it from the&  human SOULs./
* I believe this is what&  gives their SOULs the strength&  to persist after death./
* The will to keep living..^1.&* The resolve to change fate./
* Let's call this power.../
\Y* "Determination."/%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 6/
* ASGORE asked everyone&  outside the city for monsters&  that had "fallen down."/
* Their bodies came in today./
* They're still comatose..^1.&* And soon^1, they'll all&  turn into dust./
* But what happens if I&  inject "determination" into&  them?/
* If their SOULS persist&  after they perish^1, then.../
* Freedom might be closer&  than we all thought./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 7/
* We'll need a vessel to&  wield the monster SOULs&  when the time comes./
* After all^1, a monster&  cannot absorb the SOULs&  of other monsters./
* Just as a human cannot&  absorb a human SOUL.../
* So then.../
* What about something that's&  neither human nor monster?/%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 8/
* I've chosen a candidate./
* I haven't told ASGORE yet^1,&  because I want to surprise&  him with it.../
* In the center of his&  garden^1, there's something&  special./
* The first golden flower^1,&  that grew before all the&  others./
* The flower from the outside&  world./
* It appeared just before&  the queen left./
* I wonder.../
* What happens when something&  without a SOUL gains&  the will to live?/%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 9/
* things aren't going well./
* none of the bodies have&  turned into dust^1, so I&  can't get the SOULs./
* i told the families that&  i would give them the&  dust back for the funerals./
* people are starting to&  ask me what's happening./
* what do i do?/%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 10/
* experiments on the&  vessel are a failure./
* it doesn't seem to be&  any different from the&  control cases./
* whatever^1.&* they're a hassle to work&  with anyway./
* the seeds just stick to&  you^1, and won't let go.../%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 11/
* now that mettaton's made it&  big^1, he never talks to&  me anymore./
* ... except to ask when i'm&  going to finish his body./
* but i'm afraid if i finish&  his body^1, he won't need me&  anymore.../
* then we'll never be friends&  ever again./
* ... not to mention^1, every time&  i try to work on it^1, i&  just get really sweaty.../%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 12/
* nothing is happening^1.&* i don't know what to do./
* i'll just keep injecting&  everything with& "determination."/
* i want this to work./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 13/
* one of the bodies opened&  its eyes./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 14/
* Everyone that had fallen&  down.../
* ... has woken up./
* They're all walking around&  and talking like nothing&  is wrong./
* I thought they were&  goners...?/%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 15/
* Seems like this research&  was a dead end.../
* But at least we got a&  happy ending out of it...?/
* I sent the SOULS back to&  ASGORE^1, returned the&  vessel to his garden..../
* And I called all of the&  families and told them&  everyone's alive./
* I'll send everyone back&  tomorrow. :) /%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 16/
* no No NO NO NO NO NO/%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 18/
* the flower's gone./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 19/
* the families keep calling&  me to ask when everyone&  is coming home./
* what am i supposed to say?/
* i don't even answer the&  phone anymore./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 20/
* ASGORE left me five&  messages today./
* four about everyone being&  angry/
* one about this cute teacup&  he found that looks like&  me/
* thanks asgore./%%

* ENTRY NUMBER 21/
* i spend all my time at&  the garbage dump now/
* it's my element/%%
